cl-prime-maker
=============================

A simple library to generate big prime numbers in a fast way. But in some cases, the generated number is not a prime number (these are called pseudo-primes). 

Translated from the erlang version: http://www.oschina.net/code/snippet_222150_8518

##About pseudo-primes##
"The probability of mis-classifying a number is approximately 2^-100. So we can be fairly sure that the classification is correct."

##Usage##

###Load the library###

```cl
CL-USER> (ql:quickload "cl-prime-maker")
To load "cl-prime-maker":
  Load 1 ASDF system:
    cl-prime-maker
```

###Function: cl-prime-maker:make-prime###
Generates a random prime P with at least K decimal digits. Returns nil when k <= 0. Returns NIL otherwise. K should be an INTEGER.

###Function: cl-prime-maker:primep###
Tests if N is a prime number. Returns T if N is a prime number. Returns NIL otherwise. 

**NOTES**
* If n <= 65535, the detection of whether a number is prime can always get the correct answer.
* If n > 65535, the detection of whether a number is prime is based on the Fermat's little theorem.

###Function: cl-prime-maker:generate-nth-prime###
Generate the Nth prime number when N >= 1. Otherwise, this function always returns 2.

**NOTES**
* This function will cache some intermediate results to speed up the computation.
